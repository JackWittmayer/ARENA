        "In later exercises, we'll try to **modularize** our training loops. This will involve things like creating a `Trainer` class which wraps around our model, and giving it methods like `training_step` and `validation_step` which correspond to different parts of the training loop. This will make it easier to add features like logging and validation, and will also make our code more readable and easier to refactor. However, for now we've kept things simple."

        "The batch size is the number of samples in each batch (i.e. the number of samples we feed into the model at once). While training our model, we differentiate with respect to the average loss over all samples in the batch (so a smaller batch usually means the loss is more noisy). However, if you're working with large models, then often having a batch size too large will result in a memory error. This will be relevant for models later on in the course, but for now we're working with very small models so this isn't an issue.\n",

This helper function used `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to load in data, and then (optionally) the `torch.utils.data.Subset` function to return a subset of this data. Don't worry about the details of this function, it's not the kind of thing you'll need to know by heart.\n",
        "\n",
        "We then define our optimizer, using `torch.optim.Adam`. The `torch.optim` module gives a wide variety of modules, such as Adam, SGD, and RMSProp. Adam is generally the most popular and seen as the most effective in the majority of cases. We'll discuss optimizers in more detail tomorrow, but for now it's enough to understand that the optimizer calculates the amount to update parameters by (as a function of those parameters' gradients, and sometimes other inputs), and performs this update step. The first argument passed to our optimizer is the parameters of our model (because these are the values that will be updated via gradient descent), and you can also pass keyword arguments to the optimizer which change its behaviour (e.g. the learning rate).\n",

        "Sometimes, when we have a lot of different input parameters to our model, it can be helpful to use dataclasses to keep track of them all. Dataclasses are a special kind of class which come with built-in methods for initialising and printing (i.e. no need to define an `__init__` or `__repr__`). Another advantage of using them is autocompletion: when you type in `args.` in VSCode, you'll get a dropdown of all your different dataclass attributes, which can be useful when you've forgotten what you called a variable!\n",

        "* During the validation step, you should be measuring **accuracy**, which is defined as **the fraction of correctly classified images**.\n",
        "    * Note that (unlike loss) accuracy should only be logged after you've gone through the whole validation set. This is because your model doesn't update between computing different accuracies, so it doesn't make sense to log all of them separately.\n",
        "* You don't need to convert to probabilities before calculating accuracy (or even to logprobs), because softmax is an order-preserving function.\n",
        "* You can wrap your code in `with t.inference_mode():` to make sure that your model is in inference mode during validation (i.e. gradients don't propagate).\n",
        "    * Note you could also use the decorator `@t.inference_mode()` to do this, if your training loop was a function.\n",
        "* The `get_mnist` function returns both a trainset and a testset. In the `train` function above we only used the first one, but you should use both.\n",
        "* You'll need a dataloader for the testset, just like we did for the trainset. It doesn't matter whether you shuffle the testset or not, because we're not updating our model parameters during validation."

Our neural network inputs will often be RGB images and so we will have `channels=3` corresponding to the 3 colors red/green/blue. As we pass our initial image through convolutional layers, the number of channels will change. In the context of convolutions, the number of features and number of channels usually refer to the same value."

        "Note that `torch.as_strided` isn't something which will come up explicitly in much of the rest of the course (unlike `einops`). The purpose of the stride exercises is more to give you an appreciation for what's going on under the hood, so that we can build layers of abstraction on top of that during the rest of this week (and by extension this course). I see this as analogous to how [many CS courses](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) start by teaching you about languages like C and concepts like pointers and memory management before moving on to higher-level langauges like Python which abstract away these details. The hope is that when you get to the later sections of the course, you'll have the tools to understand them better."

If a parameter has its `requires_grad` attribute set to `False`, it means gradients won't be computed for this tensor during backpropagation. Thanks to PyTorch helpfully keeping track of the parameters which require gradients (using a structure called the **computational graph**), if we set `requires_grad = False` for the first few layers of parameters in our model, PyTorch will actually save us time and compute by not calculating gradients for these parameters at all.\n",
